## Who I am

My name is Tobias Robert. I am currently student in Bachelor's degree of Physics and Chemistry, at Université Clermont Auvergne. I am especially interested in the organization of the matter, and the properties of materials. Beside studying, I am involved in scouting and activity leading.

At the end of my high school, I discovered that I wanted to become a science teacher. And because I always found teachers with a background in a specific domain as the most interesting and life-changing ones, I want to explore deeper the twists and turns of chemistry before beginning my career. Thus I will be able to once share exciting anecdotes about science and create vocations amongst students while doing the most exciting work that ever existed : teacher.

Here you will find my resume, last updated on October 2025.
