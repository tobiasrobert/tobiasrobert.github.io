<b>Welcome to my portfolio website !</b>

Feel free to explore the navigation menu to find my resume as well as some overviews of projects that I achieved either for my studies or in popular education.
The base website is in English but you will also find French translation in the menu details.

My name is <b>Tobias Robert</b>. I am student in Bachelor's degree of Physics and Chemistry at Clermont Auvergne Université, in France. What an inspiring region to live in and study. From my classrooms' windows I can see, among 80 former volcanoes, the Puy-de-Dôme on top of which, thanks to a Blaise Pascal experiment led by his step-brother, has been demonstrated the existence of both the atmospheric presure and the void.
<br><br>
As a very curious person, I have many hobbies and topics of interest, between which chemistry, travelling or scouting. See more of who I am in my <a href="aboutme">resume</a>, that you can download <a href="downloads/resume_en.pdf">here</a>.
